It contains parallel clinical trials from the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry ([ReBEC](http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/)) and for the language pair English/Portuguese. The dataset includes training data and test sets for English/Portuguese and Portuguese/English. We also made available the output of the manual validation of a sample of 50 clinical trials, as described in the publication below. 

The documents are available in the BioC format described in details in the page for the [Scielo dataset](https://github.com/biomedical-translation-corpora/scielo).
